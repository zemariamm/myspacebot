in order to do direct lookups, you must have references to the entities' keys.

            counter = SimpleCounterShard(key_name=shard_name)


When an entity is first created, you have the option of passing in a string to use as the entity's key name. (in our case, the JID)

is important to note that you can only expect to update any single entity or entity group about five times a second.
